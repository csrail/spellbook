A deliverable is the expectation that a sequence of actions will complete an objective within a finite period.  It is active management when a deliverable is pursued effectively: we understand the scope of our task, the result we want, and the resources that will be committed.

A summary of the deliverable is the objective.  The objective establishes the outcome we intend to reach upon completion of the deliverable.  The objective encourages that our thoughts and actions converge towards achieving that outcome.  Thus an objective stated is a target marked.  We may be on the mark or off the mark entirely, but the importance of labelling an objective is not to know exactly where we are headed, but to acknowledge the evidence of intention.

Our intentions are basal.  Our intentions ask of us at a primal level whether we are partial towards this work, whether this work sits right with our feelings.  Understanding our intention is prophylaxis against regret and mismanagement.

If we pause and take account of our intention, the resonance in our feelings tell us immediately, and with great accuracy, whether we truly want to do the work or not.  The spark of "yes" when we are curious and excited, contrasted to the quiet "no" we neglect many times over.  Both the yes and the no indicate the desire for change, but in opposite directions.  To assess whether the intention is genuine or not, search for the intensity, for the truth might be buried deep: the yes might really be a no when we are burdened, and the yes may be buried beneath many nos when we are determined.

When the evidence for a yes is overwhelming, the next action is to secure the objective: follow a clear algorithm to manage common use cases, utilise policy to manage edge cases.

First, discretise the problem.  List the problems to be solved in discrete units without ordering.  Divide the problems into further subproblems where possible to establish a perspective of macro and micro problems.  Then assign problems as sets or elements belonging to a set to establish a hierarchy.  Then number the list in the order to which the problem needs to be solved with the understanding that macro problems and sets hold a greater contribution towards achieving the objective.

Secondly, set a time limit to complete the objective.  The constraint of time focuses our intentions, energy and resources which we would otherwise squander.  It is hoped that *as we approach the limit* we find that our intentions get closer and closer to realising the objective: that our actions bridge intentions to desired result.  A measure of time creates a dimension for us to evaluate our performance by.  Time enables us to view whether resources allocated to the deliverable are adequate and correct.  Time enables us to review whether we have stayed true to our objective.  In other words, time gives us the opportunity to enter a feedback loop that is necessary for managing the deliverable's inputs, states and outputs.  Without keeping mind of time, we would be sailing the sea without direction: neither noticing the sun rise nor set, nor if there is any wind left in our sail.

Thirdly, rest to achieve optimal production.  Reaching our time limit is the prescription that our ships needs to reach port to rest the crew and resupply.  Rest is renewal.  It is the recovery and restoration of our physical faculties, mental faculties and spirit.  Rest energises our next attempt when we return to an existing project or start a new project.  Rest rejuvenates.

Last, while staying true to the spirit of your conviction and mission, relentlessly pursue the objective: recursively divide and conquer so that as every deliverable approaches the limit, the objective is completed.

let $f(x)$ be a recursive function that takes an objective as an input:

$f(x) : \lim\limits_{deliverable \to 0} = \text{$[($conviction $\land\ $mission) $\rightarrow \$ deliverable$] \rightarrow f(x)$}$
