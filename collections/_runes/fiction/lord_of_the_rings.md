## Book One

### Chapter I

Title: A Long-Expected Party

Mettle: Gandalf convinces Bilbo to leave his ring to Frodo as an inheritance.

Summary:  Bilbo is throwing a party to celebrate his 111th birthday.  The party serves as an external distraction to neighbouring hobbits in the Shire so that Bilbo can embark on a distant adventure in full anonymity.  The party also represents an internal distraction to Bilbo who wants to use the culture of giving-away presents during birthdays as a means to make it easier to give up a particular ring.  This ring has dangerous powers that seem capable of warping its owner's thoughts: "my precious".

### Chapter II

Title: The Shadow of the Past

Mettle: Gandalf confirms with Frodo that the ring he bears is a Ring of Power with dangerous origins.

Summmary: Gandalf returns 17 years after Bilbo's party to discuss the history of the ring with Frodo, who is now 50.  The ring that Frodo possesses is a master ring forged by the dark power Sauron, to rule all others: elves, dwarves and humans: "One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them".  (Sauron loses the ring after being overthrown by Elven forces led by Gil-galad and Isildur.  The ring is found in a pool during a fishing trip by Deagol who is then strangled by an envious Smeagol.  Smeagol discovers that wearing the ring makes him invisible to others and he uses this knowledge for petty purposes.  Smeagol is disliked by many and exiled from the Shire with the name Gollum which describes his tendency to curse others.  Gollum lives in isolation and retires to a dark cave.  The ring has plans to return to its master and so when Bilbo happens upon Gollum, somehow the ring finds its way into Bilbo's possession).
