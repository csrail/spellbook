### Chapter I

Title: A Long-Expected Party

Mettle: Gandalf convinces Bilbo to leave his ring to Frodo as an inheritance.

Summary:  Bilbo is throwing a party to celebrate his 111th birthday.  The party serves as an external distraction to neighbouring hobbits in the Shire so that Bilbo can embark on a distant adventure in full anonymity.  The party also represents an internal distraction to Bilbo who wants to use the culture of giving-away presents during birthdays as a means to make it easier to give up a particular ring.  This ring has dangerous powers that seem capable of warping its owner's thoughts: "my precious".
