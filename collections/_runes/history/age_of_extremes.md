Title: The Century: A Bird's Eye View

Mettle: The 20th Century observed great contrasts across multiple dimensions: scientific, economic, political, cultural, social and human life.

Summary: The 20th century was a concentrated period of multiple wars, loss of life, which in stark contrast, also supported liberty and a population boom.  The deaths and cruelties observed in the First World War and Second World War far exceed what was previously known possible.  The joint effort of capitalism and socialism defeats fascism.  A technological milestone that separates the 20th century from the 19th century is the development of electronics (manufacturing by the nanometer), compressing what was achievable by eight millenia of agriculture and two centuries of industrialisation into a single century. The world was no longer Euro-centric, power had been redistributed to USA (capitalist) and the USSR (socialist).  Countries were no longer local, an increasing movement towards international trade ocurred with the advancement of communication and transportation technologies making transmission boundless.  At the same time, an emergence of the self-interest of the individual superceded the needs of the community: it was believed that naked self-interest would yield the best outcomes.
