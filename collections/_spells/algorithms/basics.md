Finite resources are required to solve computational problems.  These resources are put to use through algorithms which are a sequence of ordered steps taken to solve a computational problem: for every input instance a correct output is produced.  Therefore algorithms should be considered as a technology that can be strategically deployed.  Algorithms work in conjunction with data structures which are a way of organising and storing data to facilitate access and modification.
