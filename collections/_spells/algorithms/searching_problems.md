Searching problems are solved by this algorithm:

**Input:** A sequence of $n$ numbers $A = \langle a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \rangle$ and a value $ν$.

**Output:**  An index *i* such that $ν = A[i]$ or the value $-1$ if $ν$ does not appear in $A$.

We will identify $ν$ as the target value to be searched.
