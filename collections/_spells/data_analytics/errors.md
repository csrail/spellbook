## Type I Error

Type I error refers to the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that the null hypothesis is actually true. Also known as $\alpha$.

To control Type I error, the researcher sets the $\alpha$ to a lower level e.g. from 0.05 to 0.01

## Type II Error

Type II error refers to the probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis given that the alternate hypothesis is actuall true. Also known as $\beta$. As $\beta$ increases, the power of a test decreases, i.e. its reliability in detecting significance.

To control for a Type II error, increase the sample size, this will reduce $\beta$ and therefore improve the power of a test.
