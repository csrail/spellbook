Given the null hypothesis is true, the _p-value_ is the probability of getting a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the sample data. For a given probability distribution of a test, the test statistic is the delimiter value, and the p-value is equal to the area under the curve past this test statistic.

When the p-value is less than the level of significance $\alpha$, then the outcome of the test is statistically significant, and there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favour of the atlternative. When the p-value is more than the level of significance $\alpha$, then there is not enough evidence to reject the null.
