The power of a test is the probabiliy that a test of significance will detect an effect that is present in the sample data.

It is calculated as:\
$~~$$1 - \beta$

Or:\
$~~$$\displaystyle 1 - \text{Type II error}$.

If sample size increases, then $\beta$ decreases and the power of a test increases\
$\Rightarrow$ the larger the sample size, the higher the power of a test, the more we can rely on it to detect significance.
