Regarding $\mathbb{N}$, the natural numbers only includes positive integers. The natural numbers do not include 0, so cannot say non-negative integers.

Regarding $\mathbb{Q}$, $a$ is divided by $b$ and both $a$ and $b$ are integers. $b$ cannot be 0 since no number can be divided by 0.

Regarding $\mathbb{R}\backslash \mathbb{Q}$, irrational numbers are real numbers that are not rational (duh).  More precisely, they are numbers in the real system that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers, the resulting number is an infinite sequence.  Numbers such as $\pi$ which is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter; Euler's number $e$; the Golden Ratio $\phi$.

Regarding $\mathbb{R}$, $a$ is divided by $b$ and both $a$ and $b$ are integers. $b$ cannot be 0 since no number can be divided by 0.

Regarding $\mathbb{C}$, complex numbers are an extension beyond real numbers, the imaginary part to the real part since $i^{2} = -1$ cannot be satisfied in the real numbers system.
