$$
f(x) =
|x| =
\left\{
	\begin{array}
		\ \ \ x, x \geq 0 \\
		-x, x < 0
	\end{array}
\right.
$$

Given a value $x$, the function $f(x)$ returns the absolute value of $x$ such that when $x \geq 0$, return $x$, and when $x < 0$, return $-x$

The absolute function is continuous along its length and is differentiable at every point except when $x = 0$
