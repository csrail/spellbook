An understanding of complex numbers permits any polynomial to be factored.  In higher mathematics, complex numbers are used extensively beyond calculus.

$i$ is the **imaginary unit**.

Complex numbers exist in the form $a + bi :\ a,b \in \mathbb{R}$\\
$\Rightarrow$ when $b = 0$, the number is real. 

The **complex conjugate** of $a + bi$ is $a - bi$\\
That is, every complex number is associated to another complex number, the conjugate has an equal real part and an imaginary part of equal magnitude but the opposite sign.\\
$\Rightarrow$ the sum of the conjugates is a real number.\\
$\Rightarrow$ the product of the conjugates is a real number.

A complex number $a + bi$ can be plotted onto a complex plane by the co-ordinates $(a, b)$.  The horizontal axis is real, and the vertical axis is imaginary

The **fundamental theorem of algebra**:\\
let $f$ be a polynomial of degree $n$,\\
where $n > 0$,\\
$\Rightarrow f$ has exactly $n$ linear factors.

Example:\\
$x^{4} - x^{2} - 20$\\
$\Rightarrow (x^{2} - 5)(x^{2} + 4)$\\
$\Rightarrow (x + \sqrt{5})(x - \sqrt{5})(x + 2i)(x - 2i)$

Note:\\
$2i \cdot -2i$\\
$\Rightarrow -4 \cdot i^{2}$\\
$\Rightarrow -4 \cdot -1$\\
$\Rightarrow 4$
