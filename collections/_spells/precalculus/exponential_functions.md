Let $f(x) = a^{x}$ be an exponential function, where base $a > 0, a \ne 1$, where $x \in \mathbb{R}$

$D : (-\infty, \infty) \Leftrightarrow D : \mathbb{R}$, all real numbers\\
$R : (0, \infty) \Leftrightarrow R : \mathbb{R} > 0$, positive real numbers

$f(x)$ increases $\rightarrow a > 1$, increasing exponential, exponential growth\\
$f(x)$ decreases $\rightarrow 0 < a < 1$, decaying exponential, exponential decay

There is always a $y$ intercept at $(0,1)$\\
There is always a horizontal asymptote at $y = 0 \Leftrightarrow$ x-axis.\\
The exponential function is one-to-one and hence has an inverse, the logarithmic function.\\
The curve is smooth and continuous.

<u>Visualising exponential graphs:</u>
- Suppose we allow the base $a$ to equal $1$.
- Then the exponential graphs take a shape that flucutates about the image $f(x) = 1$

$f(x)$ increases $\rightarrow a > 1$\\
$f(x)$ increases slower $\rightarrow a > 1 \land a \to 1$\\
$f(x)$ = 1^{x} $\rightarrow a = 1$\\
$f(x)$ decreases faster $\rightarrow 0 < a < 1 \land a \to 0$\\
$f(x)$ decreases $\rightarrow 0 < a < 1$

<u>Exponent properties:</u>\\
Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R};\ m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$
- $a^{m}a^{n} = a^{m+n}$\\
$a$ to the $m$ times $a$ to the $n$ is $a$ to the $m$ **plus** $n$, you add the exponents.
<br>
<br>
- $\begin{aligned}a^{m} \over a^{n}\end{aligned} = a^{m-n}$\\
$a$ to the $m$ divided by $a$ to the $n$ is $a$ to the $m$ **minus** $n$, you subtract the exponents.
<br>
<br>
<br>
- $\begin{aligned}a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^{n}}\end{aligned}$\\
$a$ to the minus $n$ means one over $a$ to the $n$.
<br>
<br>
<br>
- $(ab)^{m} = a^{m}b^{m}$\\
The product $a$ $b$ raised to the $m^\text{th}$ power is the same as $a$ to the $m$, times $b$ to the $m$.
<br>
<br>
- $\begin{aligned}\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{m} = \frac{a^{m}}{b^{m}}\end{aligned}$\\
$a$ over $b$ all to the $m^\text{th}$ power is the same as $a$ to the $m^\text{th}$ divided by $b$ to the $m^\text{th}$
<br>
<br>
<br>
- $\left(a^{m}\right)^{n} = a^{mn}$\\
$a$ to the $m$ raised to the $n^\text{th}$ power is defined as $a$ to the power of $m$ times $n$.
<br>
<br>
- $\sqrt[n]{a^{m}} = a^{\frac{m}{n}}$\\
The $n^\text{th}$ root of $a$ to the $m$ is defined as $a$ to the power of $m$ over $n$.
<br>
<br>
- $a^{b^{c}} = a^{(b^{c})}$\\
Tower of exponents, $a$ to the power, $b$ to the $c$
<br>
<br>
<br>
- $a^{0} = 1, (a \ne 0)$\\
$a$ to the zero equals one, and this is true for all $a$ not equal to zero.\\
zero to the zero is not defined.
<br>
<br>
- $\|a^{2}\| = \|a\|^{2} = a^{2}$\\
The absolute value of $a$ squared is the same as the absolute value of $a$, squared, which is the same as $a$ squared without the absolute value signs.
<br>
<br>
- $a^{x}a^{y} \Leftrightarrow x = y$
