The most important base in exponential functions is the **natural base** ${\rm e}$.\\
${\rm e}$ is an irrational number between 2 and 3.\\
${\rm e}^x \approx 2.71828$

Let $f(x) = {\rm e}^x$ be the **natural exponential function.**

Let $\begin{aligned}y = \left(1 + \frac{1}{x}\right)^{x}\end{aligned}$\\
Let $y$ equal one plus 1 over $x$, all to the power of $x$

Then $\begin{aligned}\lim_{x \to \infty}y = {\rm e}\end{aligned}$\\
Then the limit of the expression $y$, as $x$ approaches infinity equals ${\rm e}$.

${\rm e}$ has a representation as an infinite sum, adding an infinite number of numbers, an infinite series.

$\begin{aligned}{\rm e} = \frac{1}{0!} + \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} + \frac{1}{3!} + \frac{1}{4!} + \ldots\end{aligned}$
