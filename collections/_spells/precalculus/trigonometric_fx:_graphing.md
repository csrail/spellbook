Trigonometric functions take the general form:

$y = d + a \sin{(bx-c)}$\\
$y$ equals $d$ plus $a$ sine, quantity, $bx$ minus $c$

$y = d + a \cos{(bx-c)}$\\
$y$ equals $d$ plus $a$ cosine, $bx$ minus $c$

$y = d + a \tan{(bx-c)}$\\
$y$ equals $d$ plus $a$ tan, $bx$ minus $c$

Where $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are coefficients or constants which alter the shape of the graph.\\
<br>
<br>
<br>
$a$ refers to the **amplitude** and **vertical directionality** of the waveform.\\
$~ ~$Amplitude is the absolute value of $a$ which is half the total height of the graph, denoted as $\|a\|$\\
$~ ~$The directionality of the graph is flipped vertically if $a$ is signed.\\
<br>
<br>
<br>
$b$ refers to the **periodicity** of the waveform and the **horizontal directionality.**\\
$~ ~$The periodicity defines the start and end of a waveform that is repeatable.  The periodicity of sine and cosine functions span $2\pi$ starting from $x = 0$ and ending at $x = 2\pi$.\\
$~ ~$The periodicity of tan functions span $\pi$ from $\displaystyle-\frac{\pi}{2}$ to $\displaystyle\frac{\pi}{2}$.\\
<br>
$~ ~$ If we look at the sine function, the start of the waveform is defined at $x = 0$, so if there is a coefficient, the start position would have the form $bx = 0$ which evaluates to $\displaystyle x = \frac{0}{b} \Rightarrow x = 0$.\\
The end of the sine function waveform is defined at $x = 2\pi$, so if there is a coefficient, the end position would have the form $bx = 2\pi$ which evaluates to $\displaystyle x = \frac{2\pi}{b}$.\\
Therefore, for a sine function, a change in $b$ does not affect start position of the period, but does affect the end position of the period.\\
<br>
$~ ~$ Contrast to the tan function, the start position of the waveform is defined at $\displaystyle x =-\frac{\pi}{2}$ so a change in the $b$ coefficient satisfies the start position at $\displaystyle bx =-\frac{\pi}{2} \Rightarrow x = -\frac{\pi/2}{b}$.\\
The end position of the waveform is defined at $\displaystyle x =\frac{\pi}{2} \Rightarrow x = \frac{\pi/2}{b}$.\\
Therefore, in a tan function, a change in $b$ has a mirror effect on the start position and end position of the period.\\
<br>
$~ ~$The directionality of the graph is flipped horizontally if $b$ is signed.\\
<br>
<br>
<br>
$c$ refers to the **phase shift** of the waveform.  The shift defines the **horizontal translation** of the waveform's period.  The shift happens in relation to the start position and end position of the waveform.\\
<br>
$~ ~$The horizontal translation of the waveform's start position takes the form\\
$\displaystyle bx - c = 0 ~~~~~~~~~~\Rightarrow x = \frac{c}{b}$\\
or\\
$\displaystyle bx - c = -\frac{\pi}{2} ~~~~~\Rightarrow x = -\frac{\frac{\pi}{2} + c}{b}$\\
depending on the waveform's periodicity.  Solving for $x$ finds the new start position in relation to the x-axis.\\
<br>
$~ ~$The horizontal translation of the waveform's end position takes the form\\
$bx - c = 2\pi$\\
or\\
$\displaystyle bx - c = \frac{\pi}{2}$\\
depending on the waveform's periodicity.  Solving for $x$ finds the new end position in relation to the x-axis.\\
<br>
<br>
<br>
$d$ refers to the **vertical translation** of the waveform.  Up if $d$ is unsigned, and down if $d$ is signed.

The cosecant and secant graphs are reciprocals of sine and cosine respectively which means that as denominators, sine and cosine cannot equal zero.  The angles which sine and cosine become zero are the vertical asymptotes.\\
$~ ~$For cosecant, the vertical asymptotes are therefore at values $\theta = n\pi ~$ since $~\sin{\theta} = 0$.\\
$~ ~$For secant, the vertical asymptotes are therefore at values $\displaystyle \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} + n\pi~$ since $~\cos{\theta} = 0$

For cotangent, this is the reciprocal of tangent, which means as denominators, tangent cannot equal zero.  Tangent becomes zero where sine is zero.\\
$~ ~$Therefore we will see vertical asymptotes at values $\theta = n\pi~$ since $~\sin{\theta} = 0 \rightarrow \tan{\theta} = 0$
