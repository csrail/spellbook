Trigonometric functions model many real world measurements by associating length with angle and revolutions.  Understanding trigonometry is essential for being successful at calculus.  Applications include surveying, astronomy, vibrations, sound waves, light waves, planetary orbits$\ldots$

Calculator usage: must change mode to use radian measure, not degree measure.

An angle is a ray that rotates about its endpoint.\\
$~ ~$start position: ray $\rightarrow$ initial side.\\
$~ ~$end position: ray $\rightarrow$ terminal side.\\
The angle is in standard position if its vertex is at the origin, and its initial side is on the positive x-axis.\\
$~\circlearrowleft$ counter-clockwise rotation $\rightarrow$ +ve angle\\
$~\circlearrowright$ clockwise rotation $\rightarrow$ -ve angle\\
When an angle rotates, the ray moves from its start position to its end position.  When two angles have the same initial and terminal sides, they are coterminal, i.e, $\mathrm{mod}\ 2\pi$

standard position:\\
origin $\to$ vertex : endpoint of ray ------------------ initial side $\to$ positive x-axis

complementary angles: $\displaystyle\sum{\text{two +ve angles} = \frac{\pi}{2} \lor 90^{\circ}}$\\
<br>
supplementary angles: $\displaystyle\sum{\text{two +ve angles} = \pi \lor 180^{\circ}}$

A radian is the angle $\theta$, within a circle of radius 1, that spans across an arc $s$ of length 1.\\
$~~~ 1\ \text{radian}~~ \approx 57.3^{\circ}$\\
$~~~ \pi\ \text{radians} = 180^{\circ}$\\
$~ 2\pi\ \text{radians} = 360^{\circ}$\\
$\displaystyle\Rightarrow 1\ \text{radian} = \left[\frac{180}{\pi}\right]^{\circ}$

An arc $s$ for a full revolution of a circle is denoted: $~s = 2\pi r$\\
A partial arc $s$ is then: $~\displaystyle s = (2\pi r)\left(\frac{\theta}{2\pi}\right) \Rightarrow s = \theta r$\\
Therefore the length of arc $s$ is proportional to the angle $\theta$ and the radius $r$

Linear Speed is the rate of change of the arc: $\displaystyle \frac{s}{t}$\\
Angular Speed is the rate of change of the angle: $\displaystyle \frac{\theta}{t}$
