Inline suggestions are automatically made when symbols are evaluated.  If you missed the opportunity for an inline suggestion, you can invoke this with `CTRL + SPC`.

Inline suggestions can become stuffed with text examples that aren't helpful, especially when you are writing code to explore the space or debug.  Go to Settings (`âŒ˜ + ,`) and disable the suggestions:

- In the text-editor: `editor.suggest.showWords`
- In the debugger console: `debug.console.historySuggestions`
